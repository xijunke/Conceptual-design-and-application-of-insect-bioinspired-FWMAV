### Bio-insect flapping wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV) is a kind of centimeter-scale air-flying robot which imitates the flapping-wing motion pattern of flying insects in order to realize flying ability and agile maneuverability similar to flapping-winged flying insects. Because of its future broad application prospects in the field of military and civilian, at present, the development of bio-insect FWMAV has become a hot research topic of some important scientific research institutions and units at home and abroad.

## The introduction of the main content:

The book is divided into nine chapters. Firstly, the research background and engineering significance, the research situation of the dipteran insect wingbeat model and the domestic and international research status of the insect-inspired flapping wing micro air vehicle (FWMAV) are elaborated, and the important problems faced by engineering design are extracted. Then the modeling theory and numerical method of computational fluid dynamics of insect flapping wing flight are summarized, and the research status of the aeroelastic noise of flapping wing flight is introduced. The sounding mechanism and noise reduction mechanism of different flapping wing species are discussed. An extended quasi-steady aerodynamic and inertial force and moment model was established to solve the problem of wingbeat dynamics and optimal aerodynamic parameters for flapping wing hovering flight with minimum energy consumption. Then, based on the quasi-steady aerodynamic model and the lumped parameterized linear model, the conceptual design framework of the flapping wing hovering flight is established. From the perspective of the development of engineering prototypes, the engineering and technical routes such as the design, manufacture and testing of the insect-inspired FWMAV are systematically expounded. Finally, the main contents of this book are summarized and the future research directions are prospected.
The book is structured in a clear-cut manner, focusing on forward-looking and systematic, highlighting the combination of theoretical issues and engineering applications. It can be used as a senior undergraduate and graduate textbook for micro air vehicle design, aerospace and micro-electromechanical systems, etc., as well as a reference book for aviation engineers and researchers in related fields.
