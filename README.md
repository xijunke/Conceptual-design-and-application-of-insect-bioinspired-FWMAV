Bio-insect flapping wing micro aerial vehicle (FWMAV) is a kind of centimeter-scale air-flying robot which imitates the flapping-wing motion pattern of flying insects in order to realize flying ability and agile maneuverability similar to flapping-winged flying insects. Because of its future broad application prospects in the field of military and civilian, at present, the development of bio-insect FWMAV has become a hot research topic of some important scientific research institutions and units at home and abroad.
