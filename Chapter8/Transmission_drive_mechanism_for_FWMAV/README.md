# Transmission_drive_mechanism_for_FWMAV

For the piezoelectric-driven Flapping Wing Micro Aerial vehicle (FWMAV), the optimal design and theoretical calculation of the planar flexible four-link transmission mechanism were carried out. The gear ratio and the optimal linearity and approximate linearity calculation codes were written respectively, and the relevant curves were drawn.

**Here, the code is written for the following topics:**

**1) The relationship between the transmission ratio of the transmission and the input displacement of the drive mechanism**

**2) Optimal linearity and approximate linearity**

**3)The sensitivity analysis of the transmission ratio for the driver mechanism.**
